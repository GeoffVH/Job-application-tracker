# Job application tracker

What gets logged, gets done. 
This extension is built to assist in tracking number of applications sent each day, display graphs showing job search activity, and organize past job applications. 

** This project is currently in development **

# User stories

1) I want to see the total number of applications sent at all times
2) I want a quick convinient button that automatically fills out details on that application. 
 - Tracks company name
 - Tracks job web post
 - Tracks date applied
 - All automatically filled in at one button click
 - Can be edited in case of special events.
3) I want to be able to see data in visual form. 
4) I want a search function to help me find past applications.
